# vue-test-utils-next

The next iteration of Vue Test Utils. It targets Vue 3.

## Installation and Usage

- yarn: `yarn add @vue/test-utils@next --dev`
- npm: `npm install @vue/test-utils@next --save-dev`

## Working with `.vue` files

There is [`vue-jest`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-jest) for loading `.vue` files into Jest. The `next` branch contains support for Vue 3. Install it with `yarn add vue-jest@next`. It lacks support for some things, namely JSX. 

If you don't want to configure things, you can download a repository with Vue 3, `@vue/test-utils@next`, `vue-jest` and TypeScript configured [here](https://github.com/lmiller1990/vtu-next-demo).

## Docs

Docs are located in [this repo](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils-next-docs). Read them [here](https://vuejs.github.io/vue-test-utils-next-docs/guide/introduction.html). They are in a separate repository because running Vuepress alongside a repo with Vue 3 causes conflicts - Vuepress expects to be running against Vue 2. This seems like the most simple solution for now.

## Development

It's a pretty small codebase at the moment. Get started by running `yarn install`. You can run the tests with `yarn test`. That's it!

There is a lot of work to do. See issues for some basic TODOs, or the table at the bottom of this page.

## What works?

See the [docs](https://vuejs.github.io/vue-test-utils-next-docs/guide/introduction.html). Most basic DOM interactions work. Advanced features like `shallowMount` and `stubs` are a work in progress.

## Contributing

This is still very much alpha - if you want to add a feature, have a hack or ping someone in Discord to chat, or check out the issues and project board.

## Comparsion with Vue Test Utils beta (targeting Vue 2)

This is table for those coming from VTU beta, comparing the two APIs. A lot of things are still a work in progress.

- ✅ - implemented
- ❌ - not yet implemented
- ⚰️ - will not be implemented (if you have a compelling use case, please open an issue)
